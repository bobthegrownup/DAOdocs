# Sales Emissions

**Grape Services are a community effort!** \
****\
****Sales Emissions are another great way for [<mark style="color:purple;">**Community Members**</mark>](../grape-community/get-involved/) to get more involved with Grape by helping to communicate our [<mark style="color:purple;">**Grape Services**</mark>](community-services.md) and getting rewarded.

A Community Member, depending on their respective [<mark style="color:purple;">**Membership Class**</mark>](../grape-community/get-involved/membership-classes.md), can claim a percentage, ranging from 3% to 9% for any service they broker between Grape and a partner.&#x20;

_Sales Emission Rewards depend on the Grape Membership Class:_

* Class C: 3%&#x20;
* Class B: 6%
* Class A: 9%
