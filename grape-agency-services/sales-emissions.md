# Sales Emissions

**Grape Services is a community effort!** \
****\
****Sales Emissions is another great way for community members to get more involved with Grape Services and get rewarded.

The relevant proposal was voted upon on-chain, passing quorum and coming into effect as of the 27th February, 2022.

As outlined, a community member, depending on their respective class, can claim a percentage, ranging from 3% to 9% for any service they assist in closing between Grape and a partner.&#x20;

_Sales Emission Rewards depend on your Grape Membership Class:_

* Class C: 3%&#x20;
* Class B: 6%
* Class A: 9%
