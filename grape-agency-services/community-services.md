# Community Services

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png>)

We are proud to be the center of excellence in the Solana ecosystem. We are even prouder of our communityâ€™s inclusivity, diversity and ethos!

After 6 months of exponential development, we are ready to harness our community power and transform it to a monetizable and value generating asset for our partners.

The **Grape** **subDAOs** are our economic and social powerhouses. They sustain value generation for the whole Grape Community. Grape is now ready to expand and offer this value as a service.

The services outlined in the attached document below, are being provided by our different [SubDAOs](../grape-subdaos/subdao-units/) **** and supported by the Grape Community; **the true power users of Solana.**&#x20;

**Our exclusive aim is to bring over our formula of community and DAO success to support our partners**:
