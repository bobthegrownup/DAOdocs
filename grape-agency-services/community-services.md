We are proud to be the center of excellence in the Solana ecosystem. We are even prouder of our communityâ€™s inclusivity, diversity, and ethos!

After 6 months of exponential development, we are ready to harness our community power and transform it into a monetizable and value-generating asset for our partners.

The **Grape** **subDAOs** are our economic and social powerhouses. They sustain value generation for the whole Grape Community. Grape is now ready to expand and offer this value as a service, in exchange for GRAPE.

The services outlined in the attached document below are being provided by our different [SubDAOs](../grape-subdaos/subdao-units/) **** and supported by the Grape Community; **the true power users of Solana.** &#x20;

**In alignment with our core goal, to strengthen the Solana ecosystem, we're now offering Community Services as well as the formula of our community and DAO success to our partners**:
