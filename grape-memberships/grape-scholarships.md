# Grape Scholarships

Candidacy Criteria:

1. Verified wallet, Class C, or Class B
2. Active in the Grape Server for at least 1 month
3. Submission of content or input on existing DAO proposals
4. In no possession of a skill role (skill role emissions alone are enough to get to the next class level)

The scholarship amounts will be distributed every epoch as part of the emission schedule and will be evaluated on a case by case basis by the DAO.

This newly initiated scholarship program mirrors our culture of ethics, fellowship, and equality of opportunity here at Grape.
