# Get involved - and benefit!

Being part of a community is easy these days. Shaping the future of an entire ecosystem? Not so much. But with Grape, you actually can! How you might ask? Well, everyone has certain skills, a special talent, or is pretty good at something. We at Grape believe that everyone can contribute, your job is to find out how. The easiest way to start and engage with the community is on Discord. [<mark style="color:purple;">**Join us!**</mark>](https://discord.gg/greatape)<mark style="color:purple;">****</mark>
