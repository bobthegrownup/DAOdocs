**Emission Schedule**

**The distribution of emissions is declared and decided by the DAO every month. These emissions are used to sustain community operations, i.e. finance events and reward skill roles.**&#x20;

Based on the current emission schedule, the inflation expected in the next year's epochs from Community Emissions are the following:

* 5.3% **January** 74.8M circulating tokens
* 4.9% **February** 80.3M circulating tokens
* 4.66% **March** 85.8M circulating tokens

To compensate token holders for the emission schedule and prevent the dilution of their voting power, token requirements are connected to the expected emissions in the next epoch.&#x20;
