# DAO Application

The Grape DAO is the highest expression of community involvement. As a member of this group, you are integral to the Grape Community and a core contributor who votes on major decisions, shaping the future of the project.

Being a DAO Member is an active undertaking and is not intended as an additional [<mark style="color:purple;">**Membership Class**</mark>](membership-classes.md), nor is it a [<mark style="color:purple;">**Skill Role**</mark>](skill-roles.md). In order to take part and get involved in the community, you donâ€™t need to be a DAO member. If you want to be though, all the better!

**Requirements**

* Must be active on a weekly basis.
* Must be a [<mark style="color:purple;">**Class A**</mark>](membership-classes.md#class-a-gorilla) member.
* Must be willing to bring value to the Grape Community.

You can find the DAO application on [<mark style="color:purple;">**Discord**</mark>](https://discord.gg/greatape) in [<mark style="color:purple;">**#dao-application**</mark>](https://discord.gg/kjZsWFen).
