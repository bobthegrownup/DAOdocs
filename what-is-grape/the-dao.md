# ðŸ”® The DAO

The [<mark style="color:purple;">**Grape DAO**</mark>](../grape-dao/dao-responsibilities.md) is the governing body of our decentralized community.\
It has one main goal: Guarantee the success of Grape by harnessing and coordinating the incredible power of our communityâ€™s effort, ability, and potential.

The most efficient way for us to achieve this is to organize everything by [<mark style="color:purple;">**Skill Roles**</mark>](../grape-community/get-involved/skill-roles.md) that engage in their respective <mark style="color:purple;">****</mark> [<mark style="color:purple;">**subDAO**</mark>](../grape-subdaos/sub-daos.md) <mark style="color:purple;"></mark> and are governed by the DAO.

The DAO is the heart of Grape. It is where all the important things happen and where the future of Grape is laid out. This is where you want to be, [<mark style="color:purple;">**get involved**</mark>](../grape-community/get-involved/)**!**
