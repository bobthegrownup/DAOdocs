# The Grape Way

The Grape Community is intended for avid Solana supporters focused on accelerating the adoption and growth of the Solana ecosystem whit their talents and enthusiasm.&#x20;

**We strive to:**

* bring more people into the Solana Ecosystem.
* support the growth and adoption of Solana projects.
* provide educational materials related to building, using, and investing on Solana.
* grow our community through collaboration, passion, and the will to succeed.

\
To accomplish this, the community has adopted a meritocratic value system where influence and voting are delegated by no one person; those who are contributing the most will have the greatest influence in decision-making.

For us “Community-First” is the guiding principle - always.&#x20;

### Values

**Transparency** – all decisions and actions will happen in a public forum and will be recorded for posterity whenever possible.

**Fairness** – everyone has an equal chance to participate and be acknowledged.

**Excellence** – we will hold each other to the highest standards and voice our opinions frequently as it is our duty.
