## FAQ

### Is Grape Access safe?

Yes! Grape takes security and privacy very seriously and Grape Access _**can only read the user's wallets**_ and their assets. Grape Access verifies that they are in control of their wallet by signing a message using their wallet locally. Their private keys are never shared with Grape and Grape only compares their signature against their public key.
