# Welcome to Grape Network!

## Grape Network

Grape Network is the toolset for Decentralized Social Networking on Solana.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Grape is using the platforms of today to build the platform of tomorrow.**
{% endhint %}

By layering blockchain solutions on top of systems, people already know and love, we are providing value to the Solana ecosystem, while simultaneously preparing users for the new interactions of the crypto future.\
\
Our bottom-up approach to building a decentralized social network focuses primarily on Discord and Twitter, creating the ultimate cultural membership – “The Great Ape Community”.
