# Organization

### subDAOs

The <mark style="color:purple;">****</mark> [<mark style="color:purple;">**subDAOs**</mark> ](../../grape-subdaos/sub-daos.md)are our economic and social powerhouses and sustain value generation for the whole Grape Community. They consist of members with specific talents recognized by a corresponding [<mark style="color:purple;">**Skill Role**</mark>](../../grape-community/get-involved/skill-roles.md).

If you have a certain skill or talent that you think can help the community and want to be part of Grape, hop on our Discord server or visit: [<mark style="color:purple;">**Get involved!**</mark>](../../grape-community/get-involved/)
