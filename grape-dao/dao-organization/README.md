# Organization

As clear frontrunners in the DAO space, it is important to remember that we are sailing in uncharted territories. Therefore, we sustain and promote a culture of constant philosophical exploration. It is our mission to develop an effective structure that will be able to operate autonomously for years to come. Flexibility and and open mindedness are our mottos in this Web3.0 journey.

## Governance

**Grape DAO Definitions:**

&#x20;**DAO:** Gorilla Members, active on discourse/discord and Realms, able to push, discuss, and vote on proposals.&#x20;

**DAO Core:** A subset of DAO Members that are accountable and responsible for every DAO-related functional category. This is an operational team managing a plethora of tasks from community bounty generation, to DAO Call minutes keeping. _This role is deserving of community emissions._

**DAO Board:** A 5-member council responsible for providing a general strategic direction for the DAO and community. An additional responsibility of the Board is to oversee and organize the DAO Core. _This role is deserving of community emissions._

## SubDAOs

The <mark style="color:purple;">****</mark> [<mark style="color:purple;">**subDAOs**</mark> ](../../grape-subdaos/sub-daos.md)are our economic and social powerhouses and sustain value generation for the whole Grape Community. They consist of members with specific talents recognized by a corresponding [<mark style="color:purple;">**Skill Role**</mark>](../../grape-community/get-involved/skill-roles.md).

If you have a certain skill or talent that you think can help the community and want to be part of Grape, hop on our Discord server or visit: [<mark style="color:purple;">**Get involved!**</mark>](../../grape-community/get-involved/)
