# üßê Additions and Removals

### **DAO Additions**

New additions are sourced from the #dao-prospects; _****_ a channel, which applicants get access after submitting a [<mark style="color:purple;">**DAO Application**</mark>](../../grape-community/get-involved/dao-application.md). Every Sunday, the past week's candidates are evaluated and are either granted or refused the DAO Role based on the mentioned [<mark style="color:purple;">**criteria**</mark>](../../grape-community/get-involved/dao-application.md).&#x20;



### **DAO Removals**

DAO members will be automatically removed in case of **inactivity**.&#x20;

The metric used to assess inactivity is lack of use/interaction with the Grape DAO's main proposal and discussion tool, Discourse, for over two weeks. Participating in the decision-making is crucial for the success of the DAO.



**Reapplication Process**

In case a member got removed from the DAO due to inactivity and wants to re-apply:

* Resubmit the form in [<mark style="color:purple;">**#dao-application**</mark>](https://discord.gg/ycGHbckZmW) __ on [<mark style="color:purple;">**Discord**</mark>](https://discord.gg/greatape).
* Once in the #dao-prospects channel, provide an explanation for:&#x20;
  * the lack of activity,&#x20;
  * the reason why you wish to return, and&#x20;
  * what you would like to do if you get to become a DAO Member again.

After that, it‚Äôs up to the DAO to accept reapplicants back. Reapplications will be evaluated every week, on Sunday‚Äôs DAO call, along with other additions and removals.

The DAO Board will keep track of all future reapplicants and accept a maximum of 2 reapplications per member.&#x20;

We realize that often life gets in the way of things. In that case, please give us a heads-up if you need to be away for a while so that we don't misinterpret your inactivity.
