# Proposals and Voting

Our main place for discussing and voting on important decisions is [Discourse](https://dao.grapenetwork.org). Every Grape member can and is encouraged to take part in improving our community by actively discussing, evaluating proposals, and - if possible - voting on them.

All members can follow the decision-making process of the Grape DAO, but only DAO members can actively take part in votes. They can see all posts and are able to vote on proposals concerning the Grape DAO and their respective subDAO.

If you’d like to discuss an interesting idea regarding Grape, head over to Discourse. If you’d like to make a proposal, speak directly to your [subDAO Rep](../sub-daos.md).
