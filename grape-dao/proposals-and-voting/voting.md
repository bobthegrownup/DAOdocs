### Voting on realms

Before you can take part in the voting process on realms, you need to deposit $GRAPE in your account. Depositing your $GRAPE on realms is also a requirement to be eligible for any Membership Rewards.

#### Depositing your $GRAPE

In order to be able to vote on realms, you must at least deposit 1 $GRAPE. The more $GRAPE you deposit, the more voting power you have. Depositing on realms is quite easy. Just head over to [<mark style="color:purple;">**https://realms.today/dao/GRAPE**</mark>](https://realms.today/dao/GRAPE/) and follow the steps below:

![Deposit your $GRAPE](../../.gitbook/assets/realms\_connect.png)

1. Connect your wallet
2. Your available $GRAPE for depositing
3. Click on 'Deposit'

{% hint style="info" %}
There is no option to adjust the amount of $GRAPE to deposit. Once you click on 'Deposit' the contract will allocate all $GRAPE in your wallet to the realms deposit.
{% endhint %}

![](../../.gitbook/assets/realms\_approve.png)

By clicking 'Deposit' you need to approve the transaction. Be aware that you need some $SOL in your wallet \[1] in order to proceed. Approving \[2] the transaction will deposit all your $GRAPE in realms.

#### Withdrawing your $GRAPE

![Withdraw your $GRAPE](../../.gitbook/assets/realms\_withdraw.png)

{% hint style="warning" %}
If the withdrawal fails, it may be that your $GRAPE are still locked in an active vote. Try and release them first (see below).
{% endhint %}

![Access your account](../../.gitbook/assets/realms\_account.png)

To release your $GRAPE, simply click on 'View' to access your realms account.

![Release your $GRAPE](../../.gitbook/assets/realms\_release.png)

Once in your account, click on 'My proposals' \[1] and then 'Release all' \[2]. This will release all your $GRAPE from all votes. Be aware that if you release $GRAPE from any ongoing vote, your voting will be withdrawn.
