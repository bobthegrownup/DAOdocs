# How to create Proposals

### Proposals

### Adding a poll for voting

You create a poll for voting with the poll builder. The poll builder can be accessed from the ![](broken-reference) in the topic composer:

This will appear once you have pressed ‘build poll’:

To show advanced options press the ![:gear:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/gear.png?v=9) icon. This will show you different poll options such as poll auto close, groups allowed to vote etc.

#### Poll Options

**Type:**

* Single Choice: Default poll type. Users can select a single choice from the poll\
  (This is the default option you want to choose for a YES|NO|ABSTAIN vote).
*   Multiple Choice: Users can select multiple choices from the poll.

    The poll creator must also define the minimum and maximum number of choices a user can make. By default, the minimum will be 1, and the maximum will be the number of poll choices.
*   Number Rating: Users can select a single number.

    The poll creator must also define the min, max and step for the number rating. For example, if the min is `2`, the max is `10`, and the step is `2`, the options will be 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10.

**Results:**

* Always visible: Default poll results. Users can always see the results of the poll, regardless of if they’ve voted.
* Only after voting: Users must vote before they can see the results of the poll.
* When the poll is closed: Poll results will only be revealed once the poll is closed.
* Staff only: Only site staff will be able to see the poll results.
