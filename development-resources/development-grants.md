# Development Grants

Grape is aiming to be the main supporting force of Solana on all fronts; From community building to development.&#x20;

To accomplish our mission on the latter, we have set up Development Grants; An initiative with an objective to enhance grape tooling and by extension, Solana’s open source solutions.&#x20;

Any of the _Grape subDAOs, Grape Partners_**,** _Solana Founder, or Great Ape community members and above_ are able to issue a Developer Grant, which developers in our, or a partner’s community, will be able to complete. In this [<mark style="color:purple;">**channel**</mark>](https://discord.gg/3wBwEWyCja)<mark style="color:purple;">**'s Pinned Message**</mark> on the Grape [<mark style="color:purple;">**Discord**</mark>](https://discord.gg/GPm5hXW8) Server, you can find the **Development Specification Form**, which must be completed for the issuance of any Development Grant.&#x20;

Once the Development Spec is filled, the Developer Grants Manager will be responsible for sourcing talent and along with the grant issuer, select the best candidate to complete the development task.&#x20;

As an incentive to community developers, completion of such grants will always be compensated and the respective developer will get an instant acceptance in the Grape [<mark style="color:purple;">**Development subDAO**</mark>](../grape-subdaos/subdao-units/development.md).&#x20;

Once a final agreement has been achieved, the next step in the process is escrowing the financial reward in $GRAPE until the completion of the grant. The escrow wallet will be Grape’s Treasury and the Developer Grants Manager the guarantor.&#x20;

****

**In summary, if you are looking to issue a Development Grant:**&#x20;

1\. Complete the Development Specification Form.&#x20;

2\. Once the Developer Grants Manager validates the Spec and finds interested developers, they select a candidate.&#x20;

3\. Escrow of the $GRAPE reward as provided in the Dev Spec. As an issuer, you will be getting updates from the chosen developer and the Developer Grants Manager until the completion of the project.
