# üí∏ Grape DAO Dashboard: 25K USDC

## First Grant Series: Grape DAO Dashboard <a href="#a7a9" id="a7a9"></a>

This is the First Grant Series: **Grape DAO Dashboard**. The bounty is for **25,000 USDC** and is pieced into components to allow for multiple individuals to get involved and work on this collectively.

In this first Grant Series, we‚Äôve focused on bringing the multi-faceted needs of the Grape community directly to the Grape Dashboard. This includes voting, payments, and governance metrics.

Depending on the success of this first grant, we will continue to add more grants and work with other protocols to continue expanding the Solana DAO tooling set.

## Rewards <a href="#a7a9" id="a7a9"></a>

The ‚ÄúGRAPE DAO Dashboard‚Äù grant is the first 25K USDC in a series of grants we will be releasing over the next few weeks. Depending on the success of this first grant, we will continue to add more grants and work with other protocols to continue expanding the Solana DAO tooling set.

The decisions we make regarding bounties are final and binding, and we may change or cancel this program at any time, for any reason.
